If you have not run the application before, you may need to setup redis (the backend database) (these instructions are for windows). 
1. Download using this link: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases/download/win-3.0.504/Redis-x64-3.0.504.zip
2. Extract the files to C:/Program Files
3. Dev script should take care of starting the server

To start the application use ./dev.sh. This script will install dependencies and then start the back and frontend applications.
'
$ ./dev.sh
